At Brian's Blackjack table, you will get to play single deck Blackjack against the house. There are a few unique rules at the Brian's table.

1. Blackjack for dealer or player will automatically end the round, and either dealer or player will be declared the winner.
2. If Player and Dealer get 21 as their first two cards dealt, this will result in a tie (push).
2. Player Blackjack will lead to a 3:2 payout. At Brian's Blackjack Table, we feel generous so we will always round you up to the nearest $1!
4. If you try to bet more than what you have labeled in "Player Cash", the game will not accept your bet. Simply click the 'reset' button to resubmit a wager.
5. The game will end once you run out of money, but don't worry; at Brian's table, you can simply hit 'Play again' and your funds will reset to $1000!
6. Good luck, and have fun!

### How does placing bets work?
Once you have started the game, simply select chips from $1 chips to $500 chips. You can add as many chips as you'd like, up to the total player cash shown on the screen. If you go over the amount, you will be prompted with a message stating you're unable to play without a proper bet. To reset your total bet, simply press the 'reset' button.

Once your bet has been submitted, you will see the player cash deduct your initial bet. If you win, you will receive double the bet and your player cash will reflect you have won. If you tie with the dealer, your player cash will go back to the amount of player cash you had prior to the round. If Dealer wins, the player cash will remain at the amount after your bet was submitted. If you receive a Blackjack the payout will be 3:2, and player cash will reflect the earnings.
